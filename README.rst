This code implements an adapted version of the safe, Bayesian optimization algorithm, SafeOpt [1]_, [2]_. It also provides a more scalable implementation based on [3]_ as well as an implementation for the original algorithm in [4]_.
The code can be used to automatically optimize a performance measures subject to a safety constraint by adapting parameters.
The prefered way of citing this code is by referring to [1] or [2].

Installation
------------
The easiest way to install the necessary python libraries is by installing pip (e.g. ``apt-get install python-pip`` on Ubuntu) and running

``pip install safeopt``

Alternatively you can clone the repository and install it using

``python setup.py install``

Usage
-----

*The easiest way to get familiar with the library is to run the interactive example ipython notebooks!*

Make sure that the ``ipywidgets`` module is installed. All functions and classes are documented on `Read The Docs <http://safeopt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.
